<!-- Task 1: Prepare the Cart HTML: -->
<!-- Currently our sidebar cart information on the shop.html page is hard-coded. The first thing we need to do is remove the hard-coded information.  -->

<!-- a. Inside the shop.html page, delete all information within the div with an id of sideBarContainer except for the first two table rows 
    (the Clown Umbrella table row and the table row with the Remove button). We will use this information inside a JavaScript file in a later task -->
<!-- (Do not accidentally delete the cart buttons) -->


<!-- Task 2: Create app.js and the cart Array: -->
<!-- Each item that is added to the shopping cart will be added to an array named cart. The cart array will be the place that we will change 
    the items in the cart. Any changes will happen in this array so that we don't accidentally mess up the cart items in the local storage. 
    We can add items to the array and remove items from the array, which will reflect in our shopping cart displayed on the screen. We will 
    create this array in a new file named app.js. This file will contain all JavaScript code that is shared between the three HTML files. The 
    cart array will be used on both the shop.html page and the cart.html page, so it is included in the app.js page. -->

<!-- a. Create a new JavaScript file inside the js folder. Name the file 'app.js' -->
<!-- b. At the top of the file, create an empty array named 'cart'. Again, this array will be used to hold all current items that are 
    in the user's shopping cart -->
<!-- c. Add <script> tags that point to the app.js file directly below the <script> tags for products.js on the shop.html page. 
    (the app.js call will be located between the products.js and shop.js script calls) -->



    <!-- Task 3: Create a Function to Save Products to Local Storage: -->
    <!-- When a user clicks on the Add to Cart button of a product, we will add that product to the cart array. The items in the 
        cart array will then be added to local storage so we can refresh the page and still see the products in the cart. The display 
        of the cart will be created in another task. -->
    
    <!-- a. Inside the shop.js page, create a new function named 'saveToLocalStorage' directly below the addProducts( ) function call. 
        Through the next steps, we will use this function to add a click event to each Add to Cart button. The function will then loop 
        through the buttons on the page and compare the button information with the information of the products in the products array and 
        find the matching product of the product that the user clicked. The information from the matched product will then be placed into 
        the cart array and the array will be saved to local storage -->
    <!-- b. We need to select every Add to Cart button on the shop.html page and add a click event to them to make them clickable. Inside 
        the saveToLocalStorage( ) function declaration, create a new variable named 'cartButton' and use getElementsByClassName( ) to grab 
        any items with the class name of cartButton -->
    <!-- c. Below the variable, create a FOR loop that loops through all the cart buttons in the cartButton variable -->
        <!-- 1. Inside the loop use an event listener to add a click event to each individual button -->
    <!-- d. Inside the click event, include an anonymous function as the callback function -->
    <!-- e. Inside the callback function create a variable named 'selectedProduct'. Set the variable to the following: -->
            <!-- let selectedProduct = products.find( (product) => product.id == cartButton[i].id); -->
    <!-- This piece of code finds the product in the products array where the id property of the product in the products array matches the 
            current item's id attribute that the user just clicked. Here is an explanation of the code: -->
        <!-- 1. let selectedProduct-> This creates a variable named selectedProduct -->
        <!-- 2. products.find( ) -> This selects the products array (found in products.js) and adds the find( ) method to it. The find( ) 
            method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The following items explain the test that is passed to the find( ) method. -->
        <!-- 3. (product) => -> Inside the find( ) method we run an arrow function. The function takes in one parameter named product. This parameter 
            will represent the current product that is being looped over inside the products array by the find( ) method -->
        <!-- 4. product.id -> The first property for every object in the products array is an id number (Example: id: 1, id: 2, etc.). This piece 
            of code selects the id number of each product in the products array -->
        <!-- 5. == cartButton[i].id -> This selects the id number of the currently selected product on which the Add to Cart button was clicked. 
            This id is then compared to the id of the product in the products array -->
    <!-- f. Directly below the selectedProduct variable declaration inside the event listener callback function, use the push( ) method to push 
            the matched selectedProduct into the cart array that you created in the previous task -->
    <!-- g. Also inside the event listener callback function, directly below the push( ) method, add the cart items to local storage using a key 
            named 'CART". Use the following code: -->
            <!-- localStorage.setItem("CART", JSON.stringify(cart) ); -->
    <!-- Here is an explanation of the code: -->
        <!-- 1. localStorage.setItem -> Creates a new entry in the local storage -->
        <!-- 2. "CART" -> Creates a new key in local storage named CART -->
        <!-- 3. JSON.stringify(cart) -> This code changes the cart array into a string. Remember, local storage only accepts string values. This is 
            assigned as the value of the CART key -->
    <!-- h. Call the saveToLocalStorage( ) function directly below the function declaration -->

    
    <!-- Task 4: Create the Display Cart Function: -->
    <!-- This task will focus on displaying the items that the user has added to the shopping cart. These items will be populated by transferring 
        the information in local storage to the cart array. The cart array will then be used to populate the shopping cart. The display of the cart 
        items will be created using a loop and a template literal. -->
    
    <!-- a. Before we begin, we need to use JavaScript to select the sideBarContainer div of our site. The sideBarContainer can be found on both the 
        shop.html page and the cart.html page. Because we are using the same container on both pages, we want to place the code to select this container 
        on the app.js page. Remember, the app.js page will hold the JS code that is used on more than one page of our site. On the app.js page, directly 
        below the the cart array declaration, create a new constant named 'sideBarContainer' that uses querySelector( ) to select any element with the id 
        of sideBarContainer -->
    <!-- b. We will base the display of the shopping cart on what is currently inside local storage. We will move the local storage information into the 
        cart array so we can manipulate it. We will use this same process in multiple areas of our site, so it's best to put this code into a function. 
        Create a new function named 'clearStorageAndCart' directly below the sideBarContainer constant delcaration. Do the following inside the function: -->
        <!-- 1. Before we move the information from local storage to the cart array, we need to clear any information that is currently inside the 
            cart array. This will help prevent any duplicate entries. Inside the clearStorageAndCart function, assign an empty array to the cart array 
            to delete any information inside -->
        <!-- 2. Next, we need to grab the information inside local storage. Directly below the empty array, create a variable named 'currentStorage' and 
            set it to the current contents of the local storage. Remember, the local storage is stored with the key of CART. Don't forget to use JSON.parse( ) 
            to parse the string into an object so it can be used in the next steps. When finished, your code should look like this: -->
            <!-- let currentStorage = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('CART')); -->
        <!-- 3. Now, we need to place the information in the currentStorage variable into the cart array. We will use an IF statement to do this because we 
            only want to move what is in local storage if there is something there. Create an IF statement to see if anything currently resides in the 
            currentStorage variable. You can use this code: -->
            <!-- if(currentStorage) { -->
        <!-- 4. Inside the IF statement, assign the currentStorage variable to the the cart array. This will place the items from the local storage inside the cart array -->
    <!-- c. The code to display the cart will be created inside a function. The sideBarContainer contents will be different on the shop.html and the cart.html 
        pages, so this function will be created on the shop.js page, not the app.js page. Create a new function named 'displayCart' directly below the 
        saveToLocalStorage function call inside the shop.js file -->
    <!-- d. The first thing we want to do inside this function is to clear the local storage and the cart array. We created a function to do this in step 2. 
        Inside the displayCart function make a function call to the clearStorageAndCart function -->
    <!-- e. Next, we want to clear the contents that are currently displaying on the page in the shopping cart. We want to do this each time the shopping cart 
        is displayed. This will help prevent duplicate entries displaying in the cart display. Directly below the clearStorageAndCart function inside the 
        displayCart function, use the innerHTML property to assign the contents of the sideBarContainer constant to an empty string -->
    <!-- f. To display the items of the cart onto the page, we will use a loop and a template literal like we did when we created the addProducts function 
        to display the products on the page. -->
        <!-- 1. Inside the displayCart function directly below the sideBarContainer empty string, create a forEach loop that loops through the items inside 
            the cart array -->
            <!-- 1a. Use an arrow function inside the loop for the callback -->
            <!-- 1b. Include a parameter named 'cartItem'. This parameter will be used to display the information from one specific cart item to the page -->
        <!-- 2. We will use the sideBarContainer constant with the innerHTML property to add the items to the page. However, we cannot use the assignment 
            operator (=) or every time it loops through the cart items it will overwrite the previous item, and we will only be able to display one item in 
            our cart. To prevent this, we will use the addition assignment operator (+=). Inside the arrow function, use the sideBarContainer constant with 
            the innerHTML property and the addition assignment operator to assign it to a template literal. The template literal will be used to display the 
            HTML code for the shopping cart items -->
        <!-- 3. Copy the two table rows and cells for the Clown Umbrella entry in the sideBarContainer div on the shop.html page and paste it inside the template 
            literal on the shop.js page. -->
            <!-- 3a. When finished, delete the Clown Umbrella row and cells inside the sideBarContainer div on the shop.html page because it is no longer needed -->
        <!-- 4. The copied code in the template literal on the shop.js page should include the following in the order given. Modify the correct information to 
            use template strings to display each item to the page instead of the hard-coded information: -->
            <!-- 4a. Two divs with the class of tableRow -->
            <!-- 4b. The first tableRow div will include two divs with the class of tableCell -->
                <!-- i. The first tableCell div will display the name of the cart item currently being looped through. Remember to use a template string in place 
                    of the Clown Umbrella hard-coded information. Example: ${cartItem.name} -->
                <!-- ii. The second tableCell div will display the price of the cart item (using a template string) currently being looped through, including a 
                    dollar sign using &dollar; -->
            <!-- 4c. The second tableRow div will include: -->
                <!-- i. A div with the classes of tableCell and borderBottom. The contents of the div will be blank. This div uses the borderBottom class to add 
                    a line between the products of the shopping cart to create a visual separation -->
                <!-- ii. An anchor tag with the following 3 classes: tableCell, borderBottom, removeLink. Again, the borderBottom class is used to create visual 
                    separation between cart items. The removeLink class is used to style the Remove link -->
                    <!-- ii1. Create an id attribute on the anchor tag. Set the id attribute to the id property of the current cart item. Example: id="${cartItem.id}". 
                        This will be used later to match the Remove link to the item to be removed inside the cart array and local storage -->
                    <!-- ii2. The href of the anchor tag should be set to a pound sign (#) so the link keeps the user on the current page when clicked. 
                        Example: href="#" -->
                    <!-- ii3. The text between the anchor tags will be the word 'Remove' -->
    <!-- g. For now, we need to call the displayCart function twice. Once to display the cart when the page is first loaded. Again, when an item is saved to 
        local storage. This will update the display of our cart when the user clicks the Add to Cart button -->
        <!-- 1. Create the first call directly below the displayCart( ) function declaration. This calls when the page first loads -->
        <!-- 2. Create the second call inside the bottom of the saveToLocalStorage( ) function directly below the local storage setItem code. This will refresh 
            the display of the cart every time the user clicks the Add to Cart button -->
