/* STEP 1: Create a function that allows a user to remove elements from an array that are chosen by the user. Name the function "removeElement". 
Include the following parameters: array, element. After creating the function, use it to remove all letter E's from the provided array */

/* STEP 2: Use the same removeElement() function to remove all letter A's */

/* STEP 3: Use the splice() method to remove the first letter I. (The second letter I will remain in the array) */	

/* STEP 4: Create a function that will replace an element in the array with a new element. Name the function "replaceElement". 
Include the following parameters: array, toReplace, replacement. After creating the function, use it to replace all letter F's with the letter A */

/* STEP 5: Create a function that will move an element to the front of an array. Name the function "moveToFront". 
Include the following parameters: array, element. Use the splice() method to remove the element and another method to add the element to 
the front of the array. After creating the function, use it to move the two letter S's to the front of the array */

/* STEP 6: Use the previously created removeElement() function to remove all of the letter T's from the array. 
HINT: Sometimes when you loop through an array that has two elements that are the same next to each other and you remove the first element, 
the loop will skip the second element. The reason why is because it removes the first element which makes all of the other elements shift to 
the left inside the array. This way the second element is now in the same place where the first element was located. Then the iterator increases 
and moves on to the next element. Because of this, you may need to modify the "removeElement" function to include i--; inside the IF statement to 
decrement the iterator of the loop after it removes an item. */

/* STEP 7: Use the splice() method to remove the first vowel in the array and a different method to remove the last consonant in the array */

/* STEP 8: Move the fourth and fifth letters to the end of the array. The fourth letter should precede with the fifth letter following. 
Use the splice method to remove both letters and another method to add the letters to the end of the array. HINT: Use a variable to hold 
the letters before adding them to the end. */

/* STEP 9: Use the previously created replaceElement() function to replace all letter S's with the letter L */

/* STEP 10: Remove the 6th, 7th, and 8th letters from the array */
	
/* STEP 11: Move the two letter L's to become the 3rd and 4th letters in the array */

/* The array should now spell out the word HOLLAND. If it doesn't, check your code before submitting */
