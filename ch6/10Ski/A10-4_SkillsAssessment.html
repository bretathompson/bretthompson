    <!-- Create your code between the <script> tags below -->
    <!-- PART ONE
        1. Create three variables with the following names and values:
            - a, 5
            - b, 8
            - c, -1
        2. Create a conditional that compares all 3 numbers and returns a popup message stating which number
        is largest. Use logical operators (and, or, etc.). You may not use min( ) or max( ) for the comparison.
        You need to use a conditional.
        Example output: "8 is the largest number"
    -->

    <!-- PART TWO 
        1. Write a FOR loop that iterates from 0 to 20. For each iteration, write to the screen whether the number is even or
        odd (on separate lines). Use the modulus operator(%) to check if the number is even or odd. HINT: Divide the number
        by 2 and if modulus returns a remainder of zero, the number is even. Example output:
            1 is odd    
            2 is even
    -->

    <script>
        let a = 5,
            b = 8,
            c = -1;

        if (a > b && a > c) {
            window.alert(a + " is the largest number");
        } else if (b > a && b > c) {
            window.alert(b + " is the largest number");
        } else {
            window.alert(c + " is the largest number");
        }

        for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
            if (i % 2 === 0) {
                document.write(i + " is even <br>");
            } else {
                document.write(i + " is odd <br>");
            }
        }
